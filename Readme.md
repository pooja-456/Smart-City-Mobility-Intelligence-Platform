## ETL and Data Transformation

The project uses **Power Query in Power BI** for data preparation and transformation.

The major steps include:

1. Importing source datasets.
2. Inspecting and understanding the data.
3. Cleaning unnecessary or inconsistent data.
4. Handling missing values.
5. Removing duplicate records where required.
6. Standardizing column names.
7. Correcting data types.
8. Transforming and preparing datasets for analysis.
9. Creating fact and dimension structures.
10. Loading the transformed data into the Power BI model.

This workflow ensures that the datasets are organized and ready for reliable analysis and visualization.

## Power BI Data Model

The project follows a structured, star-schema-oriented approach for organizing the data.

### Transit Tables

- `Fact_Trips`
- `Fact_StopTimes`
- `Dim_Route`
- `Dim_Stop`
- `Dim_Agency`
- `Dim_Calendar`
- `Dim_Shapes`

### Common Tables

- `Dim_Date`

### Road Safety

- Accident data table
- `Dim_Geography`

The geography information includes:

- Station
- Sub-division
- Zone

### Demographics

- `Fact_Demographics`
- `Dim_District`

### Ride Hailing

- `Fact_RideHailing_Ward`
- `Dim_Ward`

The model uses appropriate relationships between dimensions and analytical fact tables to support interactive filtering and dashboard analysis.

---

## DAX Measures

A dedicated measure table is used to organize analytical calculations.

Example measures include:

## DAX Measures

Total Searches =
SUM(Fact_RideHailing_Ward[Searches])

Total Bookings =
SUM(Fact_RideHailing_Ward[Bookings])

Additional DAX measures and KPIs are used across the different dashboard areas to support analytical insights.

---

## Dashboards

### Traffic Dashboard

The Traffic Dashboard provides an overview of Bengaluru's traffic conditions and patterns.

It focuses on:

- Traffic analysis
- Congestion
- Location-based insights
- Traffic KPIs
- Mobility patterns

### Reliability Dashboard

The Reliability Dashboard focuses on public-transport service performance and reliability.

It provides insights into transit operations using route, trip, stop, and timing-related information.

The dashboard helps understand how reliably public transportation services operate across the network.

### Mobility Dashboard

The Mobility Dashboard provides a broader view of Bengaluru's transportation ecosystem.

It brings together important mobility indicators and helps understand overall urban transportation patterns.

### Ride Hailing Dashboard

The Ride Hailing Dashboard analyzes Namma Yatri activity across Bengaluru.

It includes:

- Searches
- Bookings
- Completed trips
- Cancellations
- Conversion rates
